# ✊ ✋ ✌️ Rock Paper Scissors

A vanilla javascript take on the classic rock paper scissors game using dom-manipulation through event listeners

## 🔥 Game Description

You are squaring off against the computer in a best out of five match, winner take all! Be meticulous with your choice each round so you end up the victor. The user can hover over and click their best choice and see the result of the round below the game options at the end of each round. At the end of the game a reset btn will popup prompting the user to reset the game.
